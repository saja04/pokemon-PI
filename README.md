# **POKEMON** | Individual Project

## **üìå GOALS**

- Build a Single Page Application using the technologies: **React**, **Redux**, **Node**, **Express** and **Sequelize**.
- Put into practice basic style and design resources (UX: UI).
- Affirm and connect the concepts learned in the degree.
- Learn best practices.
- Learn and practice the GIT workflow.
- Use and practice testing.
<br />


## **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**

It is necessary to have at least the latest stable version of NodeJS and NPM. Make sure you have it so you can correctly install the dependencies necessary to run the project. Currently the necessary versions are:

-  **Node**: 12.18.3 or newer [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
-  **NPM**: 6.14.16 or newer [download here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

To verify which version you have installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
The current dependencies are in the versions that we have been working on during the bootcamp.

-  **react**: 17.0.1
-  **react-dom**: 17.0.1
-  **react-router-dom**: 5.2.0
-  **redux**: 4.0.5
-  **react-redux**: 7.2.3

# **HOW TO INITIALIZE THE PROJECT LOCALLY TO SEE IT**
   
   - First you have to *CLONE* this repository on your computer, you can see how to clone in [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    <br/>
   - Then, open a new terminal in the root .api/ and another one in .client/ of the project.
    <br/>
   - In both terminals, execute the following command: 'npm i' to install all necessary dependencies for the project to run correctly.
    <br/>
  - Once all dependencies are installed properly, in the .api/ terminal run the command 'npm run dev'. After a little bit you will be having that terminal as the running local server, wich will execute all the API project functionalities in due circumstances.
      <br/>
  - If you already have the api server terminal running, go to the .client/ terminal and execute the command 'npm start' to start the React App, wich is the actual page that you can navigate (the front end).
      <br/>
  - Once it runs, just as the api command, you will be running the client in that terminal so don't close any of them! Then a browser page will automatically open in the direction localhost:3000 with the client/front end site running.
      <br/>
          <br/>
              <br/>
   ‚ö†**DISCLAIMER**  DO NOT CLOSE ANY OF THE TERMINALS, remember that both client and api sides are running in them! If you want to close the full app, just kill the terminals or you can just close the text editor/code program **
